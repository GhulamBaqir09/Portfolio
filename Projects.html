                <h2>AI WARDROBE</h2>
                <p>The AI Wardrobe Consultant is a revolutionary retail system that uses advanced AI to provide personalized outfit recommendations based on a user's gender, determined by analyzing hairstyle, facial features, body shape, and more. The system utilizes augmented reality to project suggested outfits onto the user's real-time image, creating an immersive virtual fitting room experience. Users can easily customize outfits through gestures, ensuring tailored suggestions that align with their preferences. The technology aims to enhance customer experience, increase sales and loyalty, reduce return rates, and collect user data for continuous improvement, ultimately providing a convenient and futuristic way for customers to try on and choose clothes.</p>

                    <h2>AI RESTUARANT</h2>
                    <p>The project "Smart Technology in Dining: AI-Powered Restaurant Systems," supervised by Sir Waqar from June 14, 2024, to March 25, 2025, aims to enhance restaurant management through AI integration. Key features include a table reservation system to reduce wait times, an online ordering interface with personalized menu suggestions based on AI analysis of past orders, and in-restaurant ordering via table numbers. The system also supports delivery services and optimizes staff scheduling by analyzing customer flow, improving service efficiency and reducing labor costs. AI-powered chatbots manage customer inquiries, reservations, and order modifications, enhancing service and freeing staff for complex tasks. Overall, the project aims to create a highly efficient, customer-centric restaurant management system that leverages AI to streamline operations and elevate service quality, setting a new standard in the industry. </p>

                    <h2>AI PROCTOR</h2>
                    <p>The administration of academic processes like course registration, exam management, and result processing in educational institutions is often inefficient and error-prone due to traditional manual methods. This proposal introduces a comprehensive system to automate and streamline these processes, improving efficiency, accuracy, and security. Existing systems have limitations such as complexity and scalability issues. Our proposed solution aims to be user-friendly, scalable, and secure, using an Agile approach for development and feedback. The system will simplify course registration, automate admit card generation, enhance exam security, provide post-exam analysis, generate real-time results, track attendance, and ensure secure data management, ultimately revolutionizing academic administration.</p>

                    <h2>AI HOSPITAL ( Web Designing )</h2>
                    <p>For the Margalla Hospital project, I focused on designing a modern, user-friendly front-end for their website. Collaborating closely with faculty members, I gathered their requirements to ensure the design meets the needs of both staff and patients. The website features an intuitive layout with easy navigation, clear information on services, and streamlined access to important resources such as appointment scheduling and contact information. My design emphasizes a responsive and accessible interface, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. The project reflects a commitment to enhancing the hospital's online presence, making it more efficient and patient-centric.</p>
